Below is a detailed implementation plan that outlines every file change, integration point, UI/UX considerations, and error‐handling best practices for the complete Business Lead Scraper project.

---

**File: business_lead_scraper.py**  
- Step 1: Set up all necessary imports (selenium, BeautifulSoup, requests, logging, etc.) and initialize a robust logging configuration.  
- Step 2: Define the core data class (BusinessLead) and helper classes such as RateLimiter with randomized delays.  
- Step 3: Implement the two scraper classes (GoogleMapsScraper and YelpScraper) with methods to load a page, scroll, click on elements, and extract business details. Include try/except blocks to handle missing fields or timeouts gracefully.  
- Step 4: Create the DataExporter class with methods to export results as CSV and JSON, ensuring file encoding and error handling during write operations.  
- Step 5: In the main() function, integrate argparse options for keyword, location, source selection (google, yelp, both), max results, output format, and headless operation. Verify parameters and include clean shutdown routines to release the driver.

---

**File: requirements.txt**  
- Verify that all dependency versions (e.g. selenium, beautifulsoup4, webdriver-manager) are up to date and compatible.
- No functional code changes are required; this file acts as the dependency manifest.

---

**File: README.md**  
- Step 1: Document usage examples, installation instructions, supported options, and expected output formats.  
- Step 2: Include clear instructions on installing dependencies, setting up ChromeDriver, and legal/ethical considerations regarding scraping.  
- Step 3: Provide sample code blocks and screenshots (if needed, using placeholder images only when essential, e.g., for a landing overview).

---

**File: setup.py**  
- Ensure that the script automatically installs all dependencies and uses webdriver-manager to download the proper ChromeDriver.
- Include checks for Python version and create necessary output directories.
- Provide user feedback with informative logging and error handling during setup.

---

**File: config.py**  
- Separate configuration dictionaries into sections (browser, rate limiting, scraping, Google Maps selectors, Yelp selectors, output, logging, and error handling).
- Allow advanced users to update settings via a dedicated update_config() method.
- Ensure all hard-coded values from business_lead_scraper.py are replaced by configuration parameters where applicable.

---

**File: example_usage.py**  
- Provide multiple usage examples that demonstrate: basic scraping; multi-source scraping; custom data processing; error handling; and batch processing examples.
- Add descriptive comments so a developer can quickly adapt the sample code.

---

**File: test_scraper.py**  
- Write a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests including data validation, CSV export, duplicate removal, and basic error handling.
- Use temporary files for export tests and assert expected file content.
- Mock time delays and potentially web-driver interactions to test RateLimiter functionality.

---

**File: gui_scraper.py**  
- Build a modern, clean graphical user interface using tkinter with a clear layout, modern fonts (e.g., Arial), proper spacing, and a resizable window.
- Include an input section for keyword and location; a drop‑down for source selection; numeric spinbox for maximum results; check button for headless mode.
- Add a progress bar (indeterminate mode) and live updating tree view for results.
- Use a status bar that clearly confirms actions and error messages. No external icons or images will be used.
- Ensure that all UI events (start, stop, export, clear) handle errors gracefully and update the UI accordingly.

---

**File: batch_scraper.py**  
- Read queries from a CSV file and process each query sequentially while logging progress.
- Remove duplicate leads per query and combine results.
- Export individual and combined results in both CSV and JSON.
- Provide options through command-line arguments to create sample CSV and specify output directories.

---

**File: INSTALL.md**  
- Provide a step‑by‑step installation guide including system requirements, automated setup via setup.py, and manual dependency installation.
- Document troubleshooting steps for common errors such as ChromeDriver issues, permission errors, and empty results.
- Explain how to update the scraper and integrate configuration changes.

---

**File: demo.py**  
- Create an interactive demo script that demonstrates basic scraping, data structure export, configuration customization, error handling, batch processing, and GUI overview.
- Organize the demo into clear sections with headers and pause between segments for user interaction.
- Summarize generated output files and provide next steps for a real-world deployment.

---

**Summary:**  
- The plan updates each file to use robust logging, exception handling, and configuration-driven behavior.  
- business_lead_scraper.py integrates scraper logic with clearly defined classes for Google Maps and Yelp.  
- README.md, INSTALL.md, and setup.py provide thorough documentation and automated setup.  
- config.py centralizes settings allowing for easy customizations.  
- example_usage.py, test_scraper.py, and demo.py demonstrate proper functionality and testing.  
- gui_scraper.py builds a modern, stylistic UI using tkinter with a clear layout and responsive controls.  
- batch_scraper.py supports multi-query processing with clean export features.  
- The overall integration ensures user-friendly interaction, scalability, and best practices throughout the codebase.
